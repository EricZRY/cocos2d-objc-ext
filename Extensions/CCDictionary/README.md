CCDictionary
============

Uses extension : <NONE>

An extension to NSDictionary, taking the hazzle out of loading and reading dictionaries.

Indexed entries are made adding a dot, and the index.

Data in a plist can be entered in { } to allow for more complex data.
CGPoint can be entered {10, 10}
CGSize can be entered {10, 10}
CCColor can be entered {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0}
