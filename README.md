Cocos2D extensions
==================

Extensions and utility classes for cocos2d-iphone.

cocos2d-iphone-ext, will include various classes and libraries, not suitet for release with the official cocos2d-iphone. Some classes might initially be added to this repository, and then later be moved to cocos2d-iphone, when a new version is released.

Cocos2D Version
===============
V3.1 release. 

How To
======
All extensions are placed in the folder [Extensions]. There is no need to install anything. To use an extension with your project, simply copy the files from the extension folder, into your project.
If an extensions uses other extensions, this will be listed in the extension description. These additional extensions should also be copied into your project. 

If you download the entire repository, you will be able to find at least one test of each extension, showing the basics of how it is used. Please note, that as long as the repo is in beta stage, there might be changes to the extensions.

Notes
=====
CCTransformationNode is still experimental
